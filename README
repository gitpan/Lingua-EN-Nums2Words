Module: Lingua::EN::Nums2Words
Author: Lester H. Hightower, Jr. <hightowe@cpan.org>

This is a module for perl that computes English verbage from numerical values.

To install this module. Make sure you are in the directory that this README
file is in and type:

        perl Makefile.PL	# to build the Makefile
	make test		# to test the module before installing
        make install		# to install the module

After installation, you should be able to "man Lingua::EN::Nums2Words" which
will get you to usage information for the module.  The man page should be
placed somewhere like /usr/local/lib/perl5/man/man3/Lingua::EN::Nums2Words.3
and if not you should be able to "pod2man Nums2Words.pl > Nums2Words.3" and
then do "man ./Nums2Words.3" to view the man page.  The script test.pl also
fully demonstrates the module's functionality.
